# MOOD Summer School Hackathon 2023

This my work for the [MOOD Summer School 2023](https://mood-h2020.eu/event/mood-summer-school-2023/) Hackathon. I was asked to upload my code online.

I picked Hackaton A, which was about predicting the occurrence of ticks in the UK between 2014-2021. I followed a statistical approach, as I have no knowledge about geographical, climatic or biological variables.

You can find details in the Rmd file. The data is not available yet, but may be after the MOOD project will publish their findings.

Thanks to the organisers and professors and all the staff. Thanks to all my colleagues at the summer school, especially Daniele and Andrea, who gave me crucial advice.
